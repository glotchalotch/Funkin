<-- FNF WITH WIIMOTE SUPPORT by glotch -->
https://github.com/glotchalotch/Funkin-wiimote

Hello! Thanks for downloading this mod. I hope you enjoy it as much as I cried making it.
This readme will go over what you need to play this mod, and how to play it.

-- WHAT YOU NEED
For this mod, it is mandatory to have the HID Wiimote driver installed (https://www.julianloehr.de/educational-work/hid-wiimote/)
so your computer can properly recognize it.

It's also recommended (but not required) to download WiiPair, so you can easily pair it by pressing the 1 and 2 buttons while
the program is open. (https://github.com/jordanbtucker/WiiPair/releases)

To install the mod if you downloaded the light version, copy Funkin.exe and wiimote.ndll into the root directory,
and copy the assets into their respective folders. (The assets are optional but they add to the experience)

-- HOW TO PLAY
The controls are about what you'd expect in the menus.
D-Pad: Navigate up/down/left/right
A: Confirm
B: Back

While playing a song, the controls are as follows:
Tilt up/down: Up/down
Roll left/right: Left/right
+: Pause

-- TROUBLESHOOTING
I'm sure there will inevitably be some technical errors with this mod. Here are some errors that I think may pop up.

- Wiimote Read Error 1167
If you get Wiimote Read Error 1167, it probably means you disconnected the remote while playing.

- Could not load module wiimote@Setup__0
Make sure the wiimote.ndll file is in the same folder as Funkin.exe.

If you get any other error, or if the circumstances don't match what I described here, please report it to me
on github (https://github.com/glotchalotch/Funkin-wiimote) to help me squash any potential bugs.

Thanks for playing!
